    This function calculates the Euclidean distance between two observations for the KNN model to find the similarity score.
    
    Parameters
    ----------
    obs_1 : array
        An array containing the features of the first observation.
    obs_2 : array
        An array containing the features of the second observation.

    Returns
    -------
    float
        Float representing a euclidean distance between two observations.

    Examples
    --------
    obs_1 = [0.81, 0.2, -0.86, 0.08]
    obs_2 = [-0.39, 0.24, -0.77, 0.17]
